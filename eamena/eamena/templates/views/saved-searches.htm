            <p>Clearance (bulldozing and levelling) is a common cause of disturbance of archaeological sites. It often takes place to prepare the ground for a variety of uses, including construction and infrastructure projects and agricultural fields and terracing, or the deliberate looting of archaeological sites. In recent decades, increasingly easy access to bulldozers has radically increased the challenges that heritage protection organisations are facing.</p>

            <p>Agricultural and pastoral activities form another major cause of disturbance of archaeological heritage. Sites may be bulldozed to create agricultural fields/terraces or to make room for irrigation projects. Ploughing and the planting of orchards and palms seriously affect archaeological deposits buried close to the surface. Animals may trample across sites, destroying artefacts and structures; however, the presence of shepherds and their flocks can also protect sites against looters.</p>

Its imposing rampart is one of the best preserved among the pre-Islamic cities of Yemen. </p>
